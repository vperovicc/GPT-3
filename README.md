# GPT-3

I built a cool website using React.js to showcase my web skills. It's all about GPT-3, and I aimed for a modern look and dynamic feel that everyone will like.
The site has different parts like Home, What is GPT-3, Open AI, Case Studies, and Library. Plus, there's a handy navbar that moves as you scroll, making it easy to explore. 
And don't worry about the device you're using â€“ the site works great on everything, from small phones to big screens!  

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
